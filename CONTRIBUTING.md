# Contributing to See-U-Again

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the See-U-Again project! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve the project.

## Current Project Status
The project is a Flask application that provides a web interface for searching users. The back end is functional, with user management and database interaction implemented. However, the front end is not yet developed, and there are no HTML templates created.

## Pending Tasks for Contributors
1. **Front End Development**: Create HTML templates for the user interface, including:
   - A home page (`index.html`) that allows users to input their search criteria.
   - A results page to display user information retrieved from the database.

2. **Integration**: Connect the front end with the back end to ensure that user inputs are processed correctly and results are displayed.

3. **Enhancements**: 
   - Improve user validation in the `user_management.py` and `database.py` files.
   - Add error handling and user feedback mechanisms in the front end.
